# Math Function
* Created by: David Sheppard
* Created: 8 September 2018
* Last Modified: 9 September 2018 (addressed division by 0)
* Purpose: defines a math funciton with 2 integer inputs that can handle the operations listed below.
* Function Prototype: int math(int num1, int num2, char operation);
* Use: The function returns an integer result of an operation performed on two integer inputs (num1 and num2). The operation is specified as a char (see below for a list of operations).
## Conventional Operations:
* Add: +
* Subtract: -
* Multiply: *
* Divide (integer division): /
* Modulus: %
## Biwise Operations (done with the binary form of the integer):
* Shift Left: <
* Shift Right: >
* AND: &
* OR: |
* XOR: ^
* Invert: ~
- Note: the invert function only returns the inverted form of the first number (num1). A second number (num2) must still be given, but is not used.
## Limitations:
1. If division by 0 ('/' or '%') is attempted, the function returns 0. Lines 51 and 65 (in math.c) can be uncommented to stop the program when dividing by 0 instead of returning 0, if that is desired.
2. The first two inputs must be ints and the last input must be a char ---> math(int, int, char)
3. The two int inputs must be in base 10, not binary (even when doing bitwise operations).
4. All outputs are in base 10.
